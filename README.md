# HTML Repo To Android View
<p>This application is mainly to provide access to GitHub users who have a respository based under HTML, and who want to develop under a mobile database.
Usually, Chrome's judgement of devices may be weary and not true at times, and to solve that problem, using devices of one is a better solution and this project makes it happen.
<br><br>
It utilizes <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron JS</a> for it's main, application-wise front-end. For the backend, it utilizes NodeJS, with the main packages of 
Electron and <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/adb" target="_blank">Android ADB</a>. 
<br><br>
As of now, this application is only compatable with Android Devices, however, I am planning to expand this project to iOS devices.
